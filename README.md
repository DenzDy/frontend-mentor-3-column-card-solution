## My process
  Started with mobile interface before desktop since it's easier to manage and build CSS on mobile interfaces. Finished HTML, moved to layout, then finished the project with styling and responsiveness.
### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS clamp() function

### What I learned

I learned how to use clamp() to my advantage, especially when doing the responsiveness part of CSS.

### Continued development

I'd want to focus on learning shorthand versions of my code to make it cleaner and shorter. Also I'd like to further improve my skills on Responsive CSS.
